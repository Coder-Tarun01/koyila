## 📱 What is SonicSync?

SonicSync lets a group of friends play the **same audio track in perfect sync** across multiple Android phones. It uses smart clock synchronization to keep all devices aligned within milliseconds.

**Use cases:**
- 🎉 **House parties** — surround sound from everyone's phones
- 🏕️ **Outdoor hangouts** — amplify music without a speaker
- 🎧 **Shared listening** — everyone hears the same beat drop at the same time

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install the APK (v1.5 - Final Release)

1. Download the **SonicSync_v1.5_Final.apk** file to your phone.
2. **IMPORTANT:** Open it using your phone's **"Files"** or **"My Files"** app (instead of installing directly from Google Drive/WhatsApp).
3. If the "Install" button does nothing:
   - **Uninstall** any old version of SonicSync first.
   - Go to **Settings → Security** and ensure your File Manager has "Install Unknown Apps" permission enabled.
   - Disable **Google Play Protect** temporarily if it blocks the installation silently.
4. Launch **SonicSync** once installed.

### Step 2: Connect to Server

The server is deployed in the cloud — **no laptop needed!**

In the app, enter the server URL:
```
wss://koyila-bl6c.onrender.com/ws
```

Tap **CONNECT TO SERVER** → Status should show **"Connected"** ✅

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Can't connect** | Make sure you have internet. Check the server URL is correct |
| **Audio doesn't play** | Use a **direct link** to an audio file (`.mp3` / `.wav`), not a webpage |
| **App won't install** | Enable "Install from unknown sources" in Settings → Security |
| **Lag between devices** | Reconnect all devices to refresh the sync |
